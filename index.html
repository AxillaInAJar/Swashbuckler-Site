        <h1>Welcome to the official Swashbuckler Records Website! Swashbuckler Records is an independent record label at Red Bank Regional High School in Little Silver New Jersey. Here we take some of our best singers and put them to the test. They preform original songs, and bust their tails off to get it done. Not only that, but behind the scenes we have some of our best RBR students to make sure everything is published, produced, everything to get it out to you. So take some time here in this site, and get to know not only our company, but the kids and the heart behind it!</h1>
